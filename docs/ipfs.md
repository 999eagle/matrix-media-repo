# IPFS Support

TODO: An actual instructional document.

## Bugs/TODO

* [ ] Copies nearly everything into memory instead of streaming
* [ ] Downloads don't work because the nodes can be split sometimes (multiple links, RawData off the parent doesn't work)
* [ ] Delete support (see TODO)
* [ ] Overwrite support (if possible, might need to add support for changing media locations)
* [ ] General stability testing
* [ ] Use file names from database, not IPFS (because IPFS doesn't have any)
